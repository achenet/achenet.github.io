A mother once thought that she had found the most beautiful words in the English language, written by her son. They were as follows :
<br>
<br>
"and if, heaven forbid, I should die, let my epitaph say this:
He was kind, and he was useful. "
<br>
<br>

She realized her mistake several years later, upon seeing the proposed epitaph thusly amended :
<br>
<br>

"He was kind, he was useful, and he had fun. "
<br>
<br>

Today, I'm attempting to write the most beautiful thing I've ever written. I feel like it's going rather well, but I do have a history of being catastrophically over-confident about this sort of thing.
<br>
<br>

Simple is beautiful.
<br>
<br>

Joy is the experience of beauty.
<br>
<br>

Life is beauty recreating itself.
<br>
<br>

You can't argue with logic. That's the beauty of it.
<br>
<br>

And who knows? Perhaps the most beautiful words in the English language are still at large, hidden like an artfully alliterative analogy in a paragraph of prose, sulking somewhere after a full stop silently waiting to split your face with a smile and set your soul sparkling as it should be.
