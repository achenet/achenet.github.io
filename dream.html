      <p> Dream big. No matter how small you think you are, dream big. It‚Äôs normal to be afraid. When you let fear of disappointment stop you from even daring to dream, however, you‚Äôre depriving yourself, and the world, of joy. </p>
      <p>Dream. Let your imagination play freely. Be brave, and dare to dream. Allow yourself to fantasize, to imagine, to conjure up any unrealized world your soul finds fascinating. </p>
      <p>So what if it‚Äôs unrealistic? What do you know about reality anyway? Who are you to judge what can and cannot be? Do you honestly believe you have all the answers? Of course not! So why do you deny your dreams?</p>
      <p>In the world of dreams, anything is possible. Are you going to stop reading books because the stories in them aren‚Äôt real? If not, why would you stop making up your own stories? Just because you‚Äôre afraid they might not come true? Or maybe because you‚Äôre afraid they might. If you‚Äôve been living in an unhappy place for a long time, it can start to feel like home. Gloomville becomes a comfortable, familiar place. The way out can seem fraught with danger. The truth is, those ghosts and those demons are even less real than your dreams.</p>
      <p>All you have is this moment. If in this moment, you‚Äôre dreaming, embrace it. Live it fully. Dream. It doesn‚Äôt matter how small you think you are. Dream BIG.</p>
